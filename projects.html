            <p>Github is the main source for any of my development projects. It's where I do all of my version control;
                I use it to host the code for personal projects or any sizable college assignments. My repositories
                contain implementations of telecommuncations protocols (Publish-Subscribe, OpenFlow & Web Proxy) through
                Java, a full processor in hardware description language, an app to parse business reviews, a HoloLens
                project and a surgery annotation project. Even the source code for this website is on Github and
                deployed through Github pages! Click on my profile to check out my code!</p>

            <h4><b>Startup Weekend</b></h4>
            In January I attended Dublin Student Startup Weekend at Google. It was a great chance to meet some amazing
            people and see how quickly an idea can be developed with the right team. In 54 hours we developed
            <i>Studio</i>.
            Studio was created to solve two issues. Firstly; students may
            pick up skills through their college course but are not always afforded opportunities to use these
            professionally as they have little work experience. Secondly, businesses may want to leverage skilled
            professionals in areas such as
            web design, application development or photography, but cannot afford them. Studio is a platform to link
            students with businesses to solve these
            issues. The value that Studio provides to the business is the vetting of students to ensure that they are
            skilled enough, and the value for students is the management of the relationship between them and the
            business.

            <h4><b>Power Platform</b></h4>
            <p> I am a member of the Power Platform team at Evros Technology Group. As a result I have had the
                opportunity
                to work on plenty of Power Platform projects. The Microsoft Power Platform aims to accelerate digital
                transformation through technologies like low code applications, business workflows and business
                intelligence
                charts. At Evros I have worked on projects in development and R&D as well as events to raise awareness
                about
                the Power Platform. Personal highlights include getting the opportunity to build out our Visitor App as
                a
                scalable product, and a last minute presentation on Power Apps at Microsoft TechX in the RDS! The Power
                Platform has huge potential in the worlds of both development and business and I would encourage
                everyone to
                check it out. </p>

            <h4><b>HoloLens Project</b></h4>
            <p>In 2019 as part of a college software engineering project, I got to partner with Microsoft and
                develop an app for the HoloLens. When my team found out that we were chosen for the mixed reality
                project, we decided it would be a great opportunity to make a navigation app. There were no apps
                like this on the HoloLens and we saw plenty of opportunity to explore areas like speech-to-text,
                text-to-speech and drawing of augmented reality objects as well as fixed objects in the field of
                vision. We were delighted with the end result. By the end of the ten weeks our app could take voice
                input of the destination, repeat it as voice output, decode the coordinates, decide a route and
                guide the user there in augmented reality! The app passed all test cases in the emulator but was a
                bit slow when testing on the real thing due to the hardware limitations of the first HoloLens.
                Nevertheless we got a particular test case working on the actual hardware, which you can see in the
                video!</p>
