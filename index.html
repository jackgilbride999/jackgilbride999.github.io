          <p> Junior Devloper Intern at Evros Labs where I am a member of the Power Platform team. The Microsoft Power
            Platform is a set of business productivity tools; including Power Apps (low code business apps) and Power
            Automate (business productivity workflows). I was involved in the development and deployment of Power Platform

          <p> Our task was to design and develop a tool to allow a surgeon to mark regions of interest (ROIs) on a surgery video. 
            ROIs, for example, may be areas designated safe, suspicious or cancerous. The video, with the annotations, is exported
            as a JSON which is used to train IBM's machine learning algorithm to detect surgery ROIs in real-time. My role as team
            lead included client communication, documentation and team management.

          <p> In 54 hours my team developed Studio. Studio was created to solve two issues. Firstly; students may pick
            up skills through their college course but are not trusted as employees to use these skills as they don't
            have much work experience. Secondly, businesses may want to leverage skilled professions such as web design,
            application development or photography to help their business, but cannot afford to pay highly skilled
            professionals. Studio is a platform to link students with businesses to solve these issues. Studio vets
            quality to provide value to the businesses, while also managing the relationship to give value to the
            student.</p>

          <p> Our task was to design and develop a mixed reality app for the Microsoft HoloLens. We decided to create a
            mixed reality navigation app to guide a user to another location. My main tasks as back end developer were
            to
            realise speech-to-text input and text-to-speech output. These seemed like natural I/O features for a mixed
            reality app. Over the ten weeks of the project we built a fully functional app that listened for the user's
            destination, repeated it back to them and guided them to it through it with a GUI. See a test case below
            from
            one of our test sessions in Microsoft OnePlace!</p>

          <p>The goal of the project was to construct an application to explore a dataset of businesses reviews from
            Yelp.com. The app was to be developed using Java's Processing library. My main tasks as front end developer
            were front-end testing, implementing scrollbar functionality, visualising opening hours and using the
            UnfoldingMaps dymamic maps API. In the end we created a fully functioning application which queried the
            dataset from SQL and displayed business/review information in textual and graphical formats. In the end we
            were named as the winning team out of the 32 teams taking part in the project. </p><br>
